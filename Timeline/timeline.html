                <h2>An early failure (1825)</h2>
                <p>In 1825 there was an attempt to set up a Scientific and Mechanics Institution in the town. Supported
                    by a group of donors, its patron was leading Whig and large local landowner Sir John Ramsden. Its
                    aims were to instruct local mechanics and tradesmen in scientific principles relating to their work,
                    through lectures and a circulation library, which by 1827 contained over 700 volumes. The financial
                    crisis of 1825–1826 led to the failure of the institution’s bankers, and it faltered and later
                    became part of the Huddersfield Philosophical Society, an organisation with which its rules now more
                    closely aligned.[9] Some 19th-century students earned qualifications as external students of the
                    University of London.[10]</p>

                <h2>Young Men's Mental Improvement Society (1841–1843)</h2>
                <p>The history of the university is usually traced to 1841. It was in that year that five young men who
                    were employed by local industrialist Frederic Schwann,[11] who had been born in Frankfurt,
                    approached their employer for support in establishing a new subscription library and some elementary
                    educational classes, ‘to supply in some cases the deficiency of early instruction, and to procure
                    for others the means of further improvement’.[12] They first met in the Temperance Hotel, Cross
                    Church Street, Huddersfield in May 1841. Classes began for the first 40 or so pupils in the room of
                    the British School at Outcote Bank, and were taught by experienced staff from the local Collegiate
                    Schools and businessmen like Schwann. A subscription library was founded, and classes were delivered
                    in Reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, geography, design and French.</p>

                <h2>Huddersfield Mechanics' Institution (1844–1883)</h2>
                <p>The increase in student numbers prompted a move to Nelson's Buildings in New Street, and the renaming
                    of the institution to more closely reflect its remit. The first Secretary, Robert Neil, was
                    appointed in 1844, and acted not just as a Secretary but as a teacher-supervisor, influencing the
                    formative development of the organisation. In March 1844 he organised an Soiree (tea-party) for 700
                    at the town's Philosophical Hall, and in May a Rural Gala for 500 at Fixby Pastures. Negotiations
                    with the local railway company led to reduced fares into York for 300 membership to enjoy the
                    cultural opportunities of the city.[13] In 1846, Neil was succeeded by George Searle Phillips, who
                    was described by historian John O'Connell as 'philosopher, propagandist and missionary'[12] of the
                    institution. He oversaw expansion of the curriculum, revision of the fee system to make the
                    institution self-supporting, the visitation of absent students and the compilation of statistics of
                    the institution's achievements.</p>

                <h2>Technical School and Mechanics' Institute (1883–1896)</h2>
                <p>A merger took place with the town’s Female Educational Institute in 1883, and the institution become
                    the Technical School and Mechanics' Institute. A new building was constructed on what it today the
                    ring road called Queensgate that cost £20,000,[17] and was funded by the subscriptions of members
                    and philanthropic supporters. Called the Ramsden Building, after the Ramsden family who owned the
                    land upon which the building stood, the building is still in use by the Health and Human Sciences
                    Department of the university today. Before the building opened to students in 1884, it was used for
                    a five-month Fine Art and Industrial Exhibition. These kinds of exhibitions, inspired by the Great
                    Exhibition, showcased the latest in textile technology alongside copies of great masters paintings
                    or more contemporary works.</p>

                <h2>Technical College and College of Technology (1896–1970)</h2>
                <p>In 1896, the Technical School and Mechanics' Institute became the Technical College, which changed
                    its name in 1958 to become the College of Technology.<br>

                    World War I was a time of growth for the College. A Coal Tar Chemistry Department was created,
                    funded by the government and by donations which were also used to provide research scholarships in
                    Chemistry. More than 100 chemists worked at the College as research staff as products were created
                    for British Dyes Ltd.[17]<br>

                    During World War II, the College housed student teachers evacuated from Avery Hill College of
                    Education, Eltham, London (now part of the University of Greenwich), and trained members of the
                    armed forces training to be radio mechanics, engineers, fitters and clerks. Civilians also trained
                    at the College in more basic workshop skills.[17]</p>

                <h2>Huddersfield Polytechnic (1970–1992)</h2>
                <p>It was the College of Technology which, in 1970, merged with the Oastler College of Education to
                    become Huddersfield Polytechnic. The Oastler College had been founded in 1963, as a day training
                    college for school teachers. Huddersfield Polytechnic was officially inaugurated by the then
                    Education Secretary Margaret Thatcher on 23 April 1971.[17]<br>


                    David Blunkett studied at Holly Bank College
                    In 1974, a further merger took place with the Technical Teaching Training College at Holly Bank.
                    That college had been noted in education circles for its policy of training students over the age of
                    25, one of whom was the future Education Secretary David Blunkett. However, after the merger, it
                    became part of the Polytechnic's Faculty of Education, and those idiosyncrasies were gradually
                    eroded.[18] Teacher training remained on the Holly Bank site until the land was sold by the
                    university in 2001.[19]</p>

                <h2>University of Huddersfield (since 1992)</h2>
                <p>The Polytechnic became the University of Huddersfield in 1992.[20]

                    Professor Ken Durrands was Vice-Chancellor at the time the institution achieved university status.
                    He was later credited with having "transformed" it into "a thriving university".[21] However, in
                    1994 he was forced to leave his post before the end of his contract, following a row over the
                    removal of independently-elected representatives from the university's governing body.[21]<br>

                    Sir William Taylor served as Vice-Chancellor for a year during 1994 and 1995. He had previously been
                    the Vice-Chancellor of Hull University. He only intended to remain at Huddersfield for 12 months, on
                    an interim basis.[22]<br>

                    Huddersfield in 2018.<br>
                    The next Vice-Chancellor was John Tarrant, appointed in October 1995. He served in the role until
                    2006, and was later Secretary General of the Association of Commonwealth Universities until his
                    retirement in 2010.[17] The present Vice-Chancellor, Professor Bob Cryan, took over the job in
                    January 2007. At the time, he was the youngest Vice-Chancellor in the UK. His strategy for the
                    university during this time has been to lead an "inspiring, innovative University of international
                    renown".[23] In May 2007, the university welcomed Queen Elizabeth for a visit to the campus, during
                    which she unveiled the foundation stone for the new Creative Arts Building.[24] The following year,
                    the building was officially opened by the Duke of Kent.[25]<br>
                    The University is closely associated with annual events including the Huddersfield Contemporary
                    Music Festival and Huddersfield Literature Festival, both of which are partly hosted at University
                    venues.[26]<br>

                    In 2013, the University of Huddersfield was named University of the Year at the Times Higher
                    Education Awards. Accepting the award, Prof Cryan said: "It is a tribute to all the staff who have
                    worked so hard to get us where we are today. We are now well established as one of the country’s
                    innovative universities – and the best is yet to come."[27]<br>

                    The university attracts students from more than 130 countries. With an annual turnover of
                    approximately £150 million each year, it estimates it is worth £300 million annually to the local
                    economy.[17]<br>

                    The university came under scrutiny in July 2020 for the provision of training at a Bahraini centre
                    accused of facilitating state-sponsored torture.[28]<br>

                    In 2021, the university's chancellor George W. Buckley, lent his name to a new Leadership Centre at
                    the university, aimed at supporting future managers and leaders.[29]
